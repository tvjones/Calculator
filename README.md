# Calculator
TailwindCSS Framework Intro Project

This is my first attempt at building a simple project using the TailWind CSS framework. It is a simple HTML/CSS Calculator UI.
The HTML file can be found in the "dist" folder and is saved as "index.html".

Build command: npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch
